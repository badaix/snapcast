/**
 * sample and frame as defined in alsa:
 * http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/FramesPeriods
 * Say we want to work with a stereo, 16-bit, 44.1 KHz stream, one-way (meaning, either in playback or in capture direction). Then we have:
 * 'stereo' = number of channels: 2
 * 1 analog sample is represented with 16 bits = 2 bytes
 * 1 frame represents 1 analog sample from all channels; here we have 2 channels, and so:
 * 1 frame = (num_channels) * (1 sample in bytes) = (2 channels) * (2 bytes (16 bits) per sample) = 4 bytes (32 bits)
 * To sustain 2x 44.1 KHz analog rate - the system must be capable of data transfer rate, in Bytes/sec:
 * Bps_rate = (num_channels) * (1 sample in bytes) * (analog_rate) = (1 frame) * (analog_rate) = ( 2 channels ) * (2 bytes/sample) * (44100 samples/sec) =
 * 2*2*44100 = 176400 Bytes/sec (link to formula img)
