# Snapcast binary protocol

Each message sent with the Snapcast binary protocol is split up into two parts:

- A base message that provides general information like time sent/received, type of the message, message size, etc
- A typed message that carries the rest of the information

The protocol is using little endian.

## Client joining process

When a client joins a server, the following exchanges happen

1. Client opens a TCP socket to the server (default port is 1704)
1. Client sends a [Hello](#hello) message
1. Server sends a [Server Settings](#server-settings) message
1. Server sends a [Codec Header](#codec-header) message
    1. Until the server sends this, the client shouldn't play any [Wire Chunk](#wire-chunk) messages
1. The server will now send [Wire Chunk](#wire-chunk) messages, which can be fed to the audio decoder.
1. When it comes time for the client to disconnect, the socket can just be closed.
1. Client periodically sends a [Time](#time) message, carrying a sent timestamp `t_client-sent`
    1. Receives a Time response containing the client to server time delta `latency_c2s = t_server-recv - t_client-sent + t_network-latency` and the server sent timestamp `t_server-sent`
    1. Calculates `latency_s2c = t_client-recv - t_server-sent + t_network_latency`
    1. Calcutates the time diff between server and client as `(latency_c2s - latency_s2c) / 2`, eliminating the network latency (assumed to be symmetric)

### Codec Header

| payload    | char[]  | Buffer of data containing the codec header                  |

The payload depends on the used codec:

- Flac: the FLAC audio file header, as described [here](https://www.the-roberts-family.net/metadata/flac.html#:~:text=Overall%20Structure&text=It%20has%20four%20parts%3A%20a,and%20the%20actual%20audio%20data.). The decoder must be initialized with this header.
- Ogg: the vorbis stream header, as described [here](https://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html#x1-610004.2). The decoder must be initialized with this header.
- PCM: a RIFF WAVE header, as described [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIFF_WAVE). PCM is not encoded, but the decoder must know the samplerate, bit depth and number of channels, which is encoded into the header
- Opus: a dummy header is sent, containing a 4 byte ID (0x4F505553, ascii for "OPUS"), 4 byte samplerate, 2 byte bit depth, 2 byte channel count (all little endian)
