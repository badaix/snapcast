# Stream plugin

A stream plugin is an executable binary or script that is started by the server for a specific stream and offers playback control capabilities and provides information about the stream's state, as well as metadata for the currently playing track.
The Snapcast server communicates via stdin/stdout with the plugin and sends [newline delimited](http://ndjson.org/) [JSON-RPC-2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) commands and receives responses and notifications from the plugin, as described below. In upcoming releases shared library plugins might be supported as well.  
A stream is connected to a plugin with the `controlscript` stream source parameter, e.g.

```ini
[stream]
source = pipe:///tmp/snapfifo?name=MPD&controlscript=meta_mpd.py
```

If a relative path is given, Snapserver will search the script in `/usr/share/snapserver/plug-ins`. Example scripts `meta_mpd.py` and `meta_mopidy.py` are shipped with the server installation, that can be used with mpd and mopidy stream sources.
Paramters are passed to the control script using the `controlscriptparams` stream source parameter. Snapserver will always pass the parameter `--stream=<id of the stream>` and, if HTTP is enabled, `--snapcast-port=<http.port>` and `--snapcast-host=<http.host>`

A Stream plugin must support and handle the following [requests](#requests), sent by the Snapcast server

* [Plugin.Stream.Player.Control](#pluginstreamplayercontrol)
* [Plugin.Stream.Player.SetProperty](#pluginstreamplayersetproperty)
* [Plugin.Stream.Player.GetProperties](#pluginstreamplayergetproperties)

The following [notifications](#notifications) can be sent by the plugin to notify the server about changes. The `Plugin.Stream.Ready` should be fired as soon as the plugin is ready to receive commands, upon reception, the server will query the stream's [properties](#pluginstreamplayergetproperties)

* [Plugin.Stream.Player.Properties](#pluginstreamplayerproperties)
* [Plugin.Stream.Log](#pluginstreamlog)
* [Plugin.Stream.Ready](#pluginstreamready)

## Requests

The following requests will be sent by the Snapserver to the stream plugin. Upon startup Snapserver will wait for the plugin's [ready notification](#pluginstreamready) to [query the supported properties](Plugin.Stream.Player.GetProperties). The controlling capabilities are encoded into these boolean properties: `canGoNext`, `canGoPrevious`, `canPlay`, `canPause`, `canSeek`, `canControl`.
If `canControl` is `false`, the server will not send any control commands to the plugin.

### Plugin.Stream.Player.Control

Used to control the player. The property `canControl` must be `true`.

```json
{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Plugin.Stream.Player.Control", "params": {"command": "<command>", "params": { "<param 1>": <value 1>, "<param 2>": <value 2>}}}
```

#### Supported `command`s

* `play`: Start playback (if `canPlay` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `pause`: Stop playback (if `canPause` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `playPause`: Toggle play/pause (if `canPause` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `stop`: Stop playback (if `canControl` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `next`: Skip to next track (if `canGoNext` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `previous`: Skip to previous track (if `canGoPrevious` is `true`)
  * `params`: none
* `seek`: Seek forward or backward in the current track (if `canSeek` is `true`)
  * `params`:
    * `offset`: [float] seek offset in seconds
* `setPosition`: Set the current track position in seconds (if `canSeek` is `true`)
  * `params`:
    * `position`: [float] the new track position

#### Example

```

Error:

### Plugin.Stream.Player.SetProperty

Snapserver will send the `SetProperty` command to the plugin, if `canControl` is `true`.

```json
{"id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Plugin.Stream.Player.SetProperty", "params": {"<property>": <value>}}
```

##### Error

Any [json-rpc 2.0 conformant error](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) with an error message that helps the user to diagnose the error

## Notifications

### Plugin.Stream.Player.Properties

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Plugin.Stream.Player.Properties", "params": {"canControl":true,"canGoNext":true,"canGoPrevious":true,"canPause":true,"canPlay":true,"canSeek":false,"loopStatus":"none","playbackStatus":"playing","position":593.394,"shuffle":false,"volume":86,"mute":false}}
```

Same format as in [GetProperties](#pluginstreamplayergetproperties). If `metadata` is missing, the last known metadata will be used, so the plugin must not send the complete metadata if one of the properties is updated.

### Plugin.Stream.Log

Send a log message

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Plugin.Stream.Log", "params": {"severity":"Info","message":"<Log message>"}}
```

#### Supported `severity`s

* `warning` warning conditions
* `error` error conditions
* `fatal` critical conditions

### Plugin.Stream.Ready

The plugin shall send this notification when it's up and ready to receive commands
